# Tic Tac Toe

This project was bootstrapped with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and **CSS**, for icons I used **Bootstrap**.

each player must complete 3 squares in a row, column or diagonal by placing an X or O depending what player is X or O.
The winner is the one who has completed a column row or diagonal with at least 3 squares filled with his sign.
